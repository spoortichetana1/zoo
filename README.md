## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Start with **100 coins**  
Use them to buy your first egg.

### 2. Egg Shop (3 Types)

| Egg Type | Price | Rarity Range | Hatch Time |
|---------|-------|----------------|------------|
| Common  | 20    | Common → Uncommon | 8 sec |
| Rare    | 40    | Rare → Epic       | 12 sec |
| Mystic  | 80    | Epic → Legendary  | 16 sec |

Each egg contains a list of possible creatures with different incomes.

### 3. Incubator  
Shows each egg and a live countdown bar.

### 4. Zoo  
All hatched animals appear here — and each one generates **coins per second**.
